1. Based on Sold To selection we are going to identify HIS customer as in Purchase new.(Requirement ID: 2)

2. For Export controlled advance exchange parts always default plant should be 1014.(Requirement ID: 3)

                I. Who is going to handle this logic? Portal or SAP 

4. If no stock available in HIS 100B and 100C, we should place an order against 100B. And need to create case in SFDC.(Requirement ID: 6)
                I. Do we need to create a case as deferred order? 
                II. What should be subject line for case? 
                III. What are all the fields should be filled in SFDC Case?
                IV. Which approach needs to be followed? API case creation or Email case creation. If email creation, we have to involve SFDC team and align our deployment accordingly.

From Requirement ID 5 and 6, I understood below points:

1. Even though part is not available in HIS location(100B, 100C storage location) for HIS customer, we need to place an order against HIS 100B. We are not looking the Sky Harbor site.
2. In this case, it is enough to send only one request to SAP. SAP also will return only one response.
